Open Source Tiny House
=====================

The home is 198 sq/ft not including the loft. The idea was to limit a home design based on a maximum 200 sq/ft design.

The structure is not a mobile home and I made efforts to make a tiny home that didn't look like a mobile trailer. The bedroom / office is sectioned off which reduces space considerably but offers nice separation. If the house were built on skids, it could be move by trailer though.

This design does not yet include any windows. Ideally, it would be great to have required building materials before starting construction based on the modeling.

Additionally the roof, storage, and placement of utilites is still not done. My plan for the roof is a box made of 1x4 lumber, fastened to the top of the house with maybe a 1 ft overhang.

I'm giving away this home plan for free. Other tiny home plans will cost you upwards of $1,000 USD. Please consider donating contributions and money to further the project.

Enjoy! Modeled using Microsoft Visio 2010 and Sketchup.
