Open Source Tiny House
=====================

The home is 198 sq/ft not including the loft. A simple design was used to keep costs down to a minimum. The idea was to create a tiny house design that was near the lowest cost possible. 

The front of the house is 13 feet tall and has long windows to let in natural lighting. The back of the house is 11 feet tall and has one high window for the bathroom and small window in the kitchen.

In the kitchen / living area, the ceiling height is kept high to give the impression of a big space. The room has an average ceiling height of 9 feet to accommodate the loft. Both areas can fit a queen sized mattress.

The wall dividing the room of the living space is optional; the space could be used as a studio. The bathroom has room for a shower, toilet, sink, and utilities. The kitchen is designed with a half-height refrigerator and enough room is available for half width dishwasher and a full cooking range. It might be possible to fit a 38‚Äù washer dryer combo into the bedroom with a queen mattress.
